Throughout my career, I have experimented a lot with various self-organization 
tools and frameworks. Every iteration I used had its perks and drawbacks, and
I am currently in progress of switching to a new system again. I wanted to take
the opportunity of writing down the systems I used, how they worked for me
and where I have ended up now.

## Calendar and Notes
The very first "system" I used was a combination of ordinary note-taking (with
no special system) and a paper calendar. Appointments go to the calendar, everything
else is written down as a note.

### Where it excelled
It's probably no surprise that this system is a remnant from my days at 
university - it excels when your schedule is extremely fixed, because then 
it's not too difficult to connect the events with the notes.

### Where it fell short
It's actually very hard to trace and find notes if you are not taking notes
for a series of lectures, but for different meetings with different scopes,
participants, durations and so on. Keeping a deadline that is further away than,
say, 1 week is difficult, because you are only reminded about the deadline once
that week rolls around and you see it in the calendar (this depends, of course,
on the calendar).


# Calendar, Wunderlist, Evernote
This system is probably a variation of what many people out there are using.
It consists of:

- A digital calendar of the Exchange variety to manage appointments
- A ToDo list app to keep track of the items that need doing
- Some kind of filing system to store meeting notes or something similar

In my case, the ToDo list app was Wunderlist, and the filing system was Evernote.
Most to do items would go to Wunderlist, so I would either work on them immediately
or schedule them for later.

### Where it excelled
Wunderlist is great if you, like me, have a hard time remembering each and everything
people throw at you over the course of a working day. Being able to log just about
everything in the todo list app as soon as it is brought up is super valuable.

### Where it fell short
This home grown system comes with a couple of drawbacks. First of all, I was 
unfortunate enough to use two tools which rapidly decreased in quality over my
using it. Wunderlist was sold to Microsoft and not really continued any more,
Evernote was getting a pain to work with.

Then, replacing the trusty old paper calendar with Exchange came with a number
of unexpected issues. How to track the work and the personal calendar at the
same time without a) having to switch tools all the time, and b) people seeing my
personal stuff? How to keep track of the "real" agenda if many meetings I am 
invited to are optional, or I am triple booked? And how to make room for the 
important work?

That latter problem was getting increasingly difficult to handle, I will get back
to it in a bit, after explaining another unexpected drawback:

Using the phone to log items comes with two drawbacks. First, and that is under
my own control: When you open your phone, you are immediately distracted by 
notifications. It is as if dozens of other things are yelling at me to add them
to their todo list. And more often than not I was actually on the phone handling
some other minor task but not logging the actual to do. And second - depending
on the audience, typing on the phone is perceived as rude and as if you are 
not paying attention. I felt multiple times that when I took out my phone to
capture a To Do that just popped up in my mind (not always related to the current
meeting), that people were distracted by my using the phone.

The biggest problem, however, was the active management of tasks. This setup 
makes it easy to react to everything that comes to you: Meetings? Small items
that can be done directly? Urgent stuff? No problemo.

This method falls awfully short when it comes to so-called prio 2 items: Stuff
that has no deadline attached, that is not super critical, but that is still
very important. These items just tend to drop below the radar, and I found myself
scheduling calendar timeslots with myself to handle those, or scheduling the todos
in Wunderlist to a specific time and date, only to ignore them then, since too
many were popping up at the same time.

# Bullet Journal
[Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) is an easy to learn system which
requires a non-digital actual notebook and a pen. It comes with a few lightweight
rules which are supposed to enable you to keep track of your stuff.

### Where it excelled
Bullet Journal was the first real system I used that I did not create myself. 
And it worked beautifully: Tasks were no longer dropping under the radar because
Bullet Journal forces you to revisit them at least monthly. Keeping Meeting Notes
was very easy, because the flexibility of Pen and Paper is still not achieved
by digital means - if you disagree, try drawing a huge red arrow from your
current meeting notes to the notes of the previous meeting to emphasize their 
relation.

Unexpectedly, I really enjoyed the ability to draw and doodle in that book. I am 
by no means a great artist - quite the opposite - but I found that I can concentrate
more on the meeting at hand if I keep my hands busy, be it with highlighting or 
coloring the notes, or just with doodling.

Having all in one place - To Dos, Notes and other stuff - was also quite awesome,
as it provided "one source of truth" to me, and helped me to find the stuff I'm
after more quickly.

### Where it fell short
Bullet Journal, in its generic form, is not really made for very busy schedules.
Having something like 10 meetings per day means that you are constantly drawing
and redrawing calendar entries, crossing things out, replacing them and so on.

On a regular day, I filled up around 2 A5 pages of my bullet journal just with
ToDos and related notes. That means that at the end of each month, I had to
go through 40 pages hunting for forgotten ToDos and migrating them to the next 
month. On top of that, there were several ToDos that I did not want to forget, 
they had no due date (hence weren't part of any future log), but I was also not
planning on actively tackling them soon. So I was migrating them over and 
over again to a point where it became quite frustrating.

# Getting Things Done with a calendar, TickTick and OneNote
I left Bullet Journalling for [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0670899240/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) (GTD)
by David Allen - and that book was quite an eye opener for me. It introduced me
to the concept of an Inbox, where undefined "stuff" goes in and is frequently - 
at least weekly - refined and put into a proper list or it is discarded. It also
taught me a few other things:

- Have a list for stuff that you want to keep track of, but don't plan to do something anytime soon
- Have a list of stuff that others are supposed to be doing and where you want to keep track of
- Organize related items into a separate list - what Allen calls a Project
- Use a trusted "filing system" where you can put stuff in and retrieve it when needed
- Don't put stuff into a calendar if it is not due. If your priorities shift and you won't come around to doing it, you will feel bad.
- ...and much more

I used Google Calendar for my private appointments, as well as an Exchange 
calendar for the work related appointments. I used TickTick, a Todo list 
application, to collect my todos. I have set up tags and sub lists to adress
the needs of GTD.

My reference system was OneNote, which I have set up to be able to receive 
emails and to capture full websites for me when needed.


### Where it excelled
GTD really was a huge leap forward in productivity. I want to bring up three
things which really made a difference to me:

- The Weekly Review: Every week, I work through all the To Dos which have found their way into my inbox. GTD comes with some handy advice on how to efficiently do the review, and I found that my Tuesdays, the day where I would usually do the weekly review, where among my most productive days.
- The Waiting List: GTD advises you to delegate tasks whenever possible, and maintain a waiting list to keep track of delegated tasks, and remind people when necessary. This was a big deal for me, because I found that I mostly forgot about things I delegated to others, trusting them to do it, and when they didn't - well, I didn't even notice.
- The concept of an Inbox: GTD teaches you that there are Inboxes everywhere, filled with stuff for you to work on. He advises to have as little inboxes as possible, and clean them every week. This is a fantastic way to keep an overview over everything that is going on in my life. Very few things get lost.

### Where it fell short
One word: Technology.
