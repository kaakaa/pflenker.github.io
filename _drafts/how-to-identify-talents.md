Creating and fostering an environment in which any member of a team can fully
unfold their talents is a critical skill for leaders in any modern environment.
One often-neglected aspect of this is actually identifying talents which lie
dormant within the team - after all, before making any talent grow, you need to
find it first.

Someone has a talent for something if what is hard for others to do comes easy
for them.

This is different from a skill, which you can learn and develop. I am a skilled
guitarist - I practice a lot - but I am not very talented. If I were to give you
a concert, there would be a high risk that you would be leaving, whereas a
talented guitarist might provoke more positive reactions. Practice doesn't play
a role here - we both practiced.

## Asking People for Their Talents Isn't Enough
It's not sufficient to simply go ahead and ask people about their talents - what
they are good at, what they like, and so on. The first reason for this is
simple: If you don't know how hard something is for *others*, it'll be difficult
for you to identify this as a talent of yours. In other words: We might be good
at something without even knowing.

Secondly, you have lots and lots of talents - but you'll never discover most of
them. Maybe I am a talented oboist - but I have never played the oboe, nor do I
plan to, so this talent will lay dormant, undiscovered, within me until I will
pick up the instrument. 

A talent is only apparent when it's confronted with a problem. If you are never
confronted with a specific problem, you will never know if you have a talent for
solving it.

## Draw Out Talents by Provoking People With Problems
As a leader, you have no other choice than to repeatedly provoke your team
members with different problems, and check their response to it. Are they
afraid, annoyed - or delighted? Do they shy away from the problem or embrace it?
And if they embrace it - are they actually making a good job of solving it?

I should say that provoking people with problems is not the same as putting
people under stress by exposing them to topics too big for them to handle. If
you want people to try out their skills and talents, you need to make sure it's
safe to try, safe to fail and safe to learn. Otherwise, even talented people
might hold back to avoid negative consequences of failure.

## Create an Environment That Uncovers Talents
Going a step further, it's not sufficient to take a break from day to day
activities every now and then to start focussing on identifying talents.
Instead, the whole working environment of a team needs to be designed around
provoking the team with problems. It needs to happen constantly, on a daily
basis, so that it's part of the everyday exploration of the problem space of
your team.

A simple example is deliberately creating a vacuum - if there is a problem that
needs fixing, don't go in and solve it all on your own. Make sure it's visible,
and then take a step back - and see who steps into the vacuum and solves it.
