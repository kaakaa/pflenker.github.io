excerpt: "Communication is all about transmitting information from one person to the next, right? No, it's both less and more than that."

Most people see communication as a transaction: One party of the communication,
the *sender*, transmits a piece of information to one or more involved parties,
the *receiver*. Any communication issues revolve around the encoding and
decoding of this message - for example, if the receiver decodes a meaning that
the sender did not intend to send (for instance with their tone of voice), we
have a communication problem.

My personal mental modal for communication can be demonstrated fairly easily:
Think about a song, any song. It can be from the charts, or a child's song.
Then, while you are playing it in your head, tap along with the song, and ask
someone to guess it. This works best in a group of, say, 10 people.

Before they do, write down how likely it is that someone identifies the song.
Then compare your estimates with the actual number of people being able to
identify the song.

The result is usually that we feel very confident that people can identify the
song, because it's so *obvious*, but people usually fail spectacularly  when
they have to make a guess based on the tapping alone.

From my perspective, this exercise sums up a lot about what there is to say
about communication.

# Regardless of What We Do, We Always Meet Our Own Thoughts

However, I recently was pointed toward [this video in
German](https://vimeo.com/157836061), in which the author basically says that we
are not transmitting anything: Even something as simple as asking for the time
breaks down into *making the socially accepted noises from which I hope the
other will interpret them correctly*,  to which the other party reacts with
*generating even more noises which I interpret as the answer*.

The crucial point in this thinking is that this works only because we have done
these noises countless times before, there is something like a consensus around
what they mean. But what if we discuss things where there is no such consensus?

The video gives the example of a social consensus that it's preferable to be
rich and healthy rather than poor and sick. If someone communicates that they
would rather be poor and sick, then this is at conflict with the consensus, and
this is where the communicator simply can't generate the generally accepted
noises which convey that they'd prefer being poor and sick over being rich and
healthy. So we'd need to start communicating about issues on which we already
have consensus to lay the foundation about the parts where we have communication
issues.

# What's This? What's this?
This video has been sent to me shortly before Halloween, and it just so happens
that I found a scene in a well-known Halloween movie which illustrates this point 
very nicely.

In Tim Burton's "A Nightmare Before Christmas", every holiday has its own city.
Jack Skellington, the leader of Halloween, visits Christmas Town and becomes
infatuated with it. He returns to Halloween Town, gathers a Town Meeting and
tries to communicate what he has just seen. [This part has its own
song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAHXzDUT9hs)

Now, everyone likes Jack, they are open to his explanations, they are doing
their best to understand his message, and he is giving it all to explain what he
has seen. But the concepts of Christmas - not scary, but kind and fun -  are far
beyond anything they have a consensus for, so they genuinely don't understand
the point Jack is trying to make.

At the end, he gives in and pretends that Santa Clause is some kind of a scary
evil overlord called Sandy Claws, and the folks of Halloween gleefully get to
work on their version of Christmas. As you can imagine, this doesn't end well.

## The Willingness to Communicate is Not Enough
This demonstrates nicely how even under the best possible circumstances -
everybody is listening attentively, and actively trying to understand what you
are saying - communication still can fail. The willingness to communicate and
understand is simply not enough for effective communication.
