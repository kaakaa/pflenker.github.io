excerpt: "Staff Liquidity provides an alternative or addition to adding more people to a team, by focussing on raising the level of experts for certain roles within the team."

It's a typical complaint from any Engineering Team: We are too small, we need more people to deliver high quality software faster. From the team leadership perspective, things get complicated fast: What kind of roles do we need to fill? (Don't forget to [take into account that there is more to consider than just the job title!]({% post_url 2020-10-21-focus-on-the-right-roles %})) How high is the risk that this role will eventually run out of work, since there is a bottleneck elsewhere in our team, or because customer demand changes? And perhaps most critically, does the new person arrive on time? Adding new people to the team means, even if we lived in a world where a recruitment process would nonexistent, that we have to invest time of other team members to ramp up the new hire. For the first few months, we will be investing more time and effort than we will be getting out of it.

Staff Liquidity can help address these issues, by putting things into a different perspective.
