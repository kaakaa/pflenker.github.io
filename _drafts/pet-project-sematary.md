Let's start with a confession: I am Philipp, and I am hoarding pet projects.
Throughout my whole life, well before my formal education as a computer scientist,
I used pet projects to create new things, often by remixing or extending other 
existing things. Depending on how far things got, I started telling my family and
friends about it, hyping my own idea, before eventually getting bored of it and deleting 
it.

But my pet projects are more than random stuff that I do besides work - looking
back at my projects is a bit as flipping through an old photo album: You can see 
what has been en vogue that year and how it affected me, and you can see my personal
development and growth as a thread throughout all these projects.

So I have decided to put up a Pet Project Cemetary - a collection of projects that 
were fun doing, that brought me some extensive learning, or both. And sometimes, 
as the pets in Stephen King's "Pet Sematary", some of the projects, though thought dead,
rise back up an
d come haunting you.

Before diving in, we should probably clarify one thing: Pet projects never indended
to reflect my own working expertise, so this collection is far from a polished, shiny portfolio.
Quite the contrary, this is what I was doing when I thought no one was looking.
