I have to confess something: I am somewhat of a pet project hoarder.
Throughout my whole life, well before my formal education as a computer scientist,
I have been creating new things on the computer, usually by remixing or duplicating 
already existing things. Depending on how far things got, I started telling my family and
friends about it, hyping my own idea, before eventually getting bored of it and deleting 
it.

I used to feel bad about all those pet projects I started and never finished, but
over the years I have come to realize that I learn and grow with each and every one
of them. In a way, looking back at my projects is a bit as flipping through an old photo album: You can see 
what has been en vogue that year and how it affected me, and you can see my personal
development and growth as a thread throughout all these projects.

So I have decided to put up a Pet Project Cemetary - a collection of projects that 
were fun doing, that brought me some extensive learning, or both. And sometimes, 
as the pets in Stephen King's "Pet Sematary", some of the projects, though thought dead,
rise back up and come haunting you.

## Pet projects are not a portfolio
I feel sufficiently embarassed by my own previous work so that I have to add the
following disclaimer: This is not intended to be a portfolio of my greatest work.
If anything, this is the opposite: Stuff that I create when no one is looking and 
when nothing I do really matters.
