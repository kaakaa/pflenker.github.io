hecto is actually one of my better side projects. It's still around, you can 
find it [here]({% post_url 2019-11-08-rust-text-editor%}), and from what I can see
from the Google Search results, the hecto pages are among the most popular pages on this blog 
to date.

## What it was
I wanted to learn a new programming language, beyond my usual stack of Mongo, Express/Koa, React and Node. Specifically, I wanted to learn Rust. So I looked for a problem to solve in Rust - being mainly developing for the web, all the problems that I came up with myself where somehow web related. 

I stumbled across a tutorial on how to build a simple text editor in C, which seemed as an ideal candidate. So, true to how I usually approach pet projects, I remixed the original tutorial plus code into a Rust tutorial plus code - not by translating every function into its C equivalent, but by trying to do things "the Rust way".
