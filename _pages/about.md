Hallo und Hi There, thanks for stopping by! I'm Philipp, a Software Engineering Manager residing in Luedinghausen, North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany, with a focus on optimizing for productivity and happiness.

I obtained my Master's Degree in Computer Science from the [Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universität Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de) in 2011. Since then, I have mainly worked as a Product Owner, Product Manager, Dev Lead, Agile Coach or a combination.

I love technology, and one of my ealier childhood memories is feeding long rows of `DATA` from a computer magazine into my Commodore 64 - only to be rewarded with `?SYNTAX ERROR IN LINE 2342`. However, during my first job as a graduate, I started to discover that while a talented developer can save more than just the project, a focussed team of engineers is nigh unstoppable - which is why I decided that focussing on the technology alone would not be enough.

So I have dedicated most of my professional career to figuring out how to bring people together, focus them as teams toward a common goal and remove all unnecessary hindrances along the way.

In that regard, I am usually favoring agile approaches, but I am not opinionated in that regard - the client or customer will praise you for a product well done, and not for a process well executed.

If you are interested, you can find my CV on [LinkedIn (English)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pflenker/) or [Xing (German)](https://www.xing.com/profile/Philipp_Flenker/).

In my spare time, I code stuff to make sure I stay up to date with current tech trends. These days, I dabble with React, React Native and NodeJS. And if you want me to build your next app, form your next team or kickstart your next product, you can also hire me!

You can contact me at [hello@philippflenker.com](mailto:hello@philippflenker.com) if you want to get in touch, start a discussion or simply say hi!
