Hallo und Hi There, thanks for stopping by! I'm Philipp, a Software Engineering Manager residing in Luedinghausen, North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany, with a focus on building happy and productive teams.

I obtained my Master's Degree in Computer Science from the [Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universität Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de) in 2011. Since then, I have mainly worked as a Product Owner, Product Manager, Team Lead, Agile Coach or a combination.

I love technology, and one of my ealier childhood memories is feeding long rows of `DATA` from a computer magazine into my Commodore 64 - only to be rewarded with `?SYNTAX ERROR IN LINE 82` (If you are interested, [you can read the full story here](/sematary/what-me-worry)!). However, during my first job as a graduate, I started to discover that while a talented developer can save more than just the project, a focussed team of engineers is nigh unstoppable - which is why I decided that focussing on the technology alone would not be enough. 

So I have dedicated most of my professional career to figuring out how to bring people together, focus them as teams toward a common goal and remove all unnecessary hindrances along the way. I believe that a good manager or leader's job is to bring people together as a team, keep them focussed on the goal, protect them from distractions and trust them to get the job done. I am humbled and proud to say that this people-first approach has been rewarded by my peers at OpusCapita, [who made me the only person to receive the internal Value Ambassador award two times.](https://www.opuscapita.com/blog/2020/meet-philipp-flenker)

If you are interested in my professional background, you can find my CV on [LinkedIn (English)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pflenker/) or [Xing (German)](https://www.xing.com/profile/Philipp_Flenker/).

In my spare time, I code stuff to make sure I stay up to date with current tech trends. These days, I dabble with React, React Native, Rust and TypeScript. 

You can contact me at [hello@philippflenker.com](mailto:hello@philippflenker.com) if you want to get in touch, start a discussion or simply say hi!
