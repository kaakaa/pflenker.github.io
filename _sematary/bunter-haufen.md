excerpt: "The Bunte Haufen was a social project to save the Junges Theater in Göttingen. Additionally, it was the first of my projects ever to be used by other people."

The Bunter Haufen project was the first of my side project to be actually used
by others.

At the time, I was working and acting at a local theater in Göttingen. and that
theater was cut off federal funding. Various organization have popped up to
raise awareness of the issue and trz to save the theater, and the Bunter Haufen
("colorful bunch") was one of those. 

## What it was
A web presence and a mailing list for the group, with the purpose of
coordinating actions and demonstrations, as well as communicating changes and
updates to everyone who is interested.

## What I learned
It's one thing to do something for fun, but it's something else entirely to do
something other people will use. Bugs, issues and workarounds which I, as a
teenage hobbyist would have found acceptable are just not good enough for actual
users. For example, the fact that I used a publicly visible variable called
`phil` to identify the desired sub page (So if you wanted to see the imprint, you
had to visit `index.php?phil=imprint`) seemed fun and edgy to me, but was
somehow confusing for the actual visitors of the page (Remember that back then
it was far more common to actually type out the address of the page you wanted to
visit)

So I found the work on that page and mailing list surprisingly demanding, but
also very fulfilling. 

### A Human Mistake Is Not A Virus
Imagine you are still in school. It's around 6 am, and since you are a teenager,
this is brutally early. Your cell phone rings - it's your teacher, yelling at
you!

This teenage nightmare actually happened to me. So why the yelling? Well, over
night some spammer has sent an email to the mailing list - which was open for
anyone to send anything. This email was bounced back by a full inbox to the
whole mailing list - which delivered it back to the account with the overflowing
mailbox. Which then bounced it back.

After a while, other emails began overflowing and bouncing mails back, so every
bounced mail created a multitude of other emails.

This is where the teacher came in. He was a subscriber to the mailing list and
opened his mailbox in the morning and found it full of what looked like spam. He
proceeded to clean his inbox, which was immediately stuffed full again with even
more spam messages.

I turned off the mailing list immediately, but it took hours for all mails to be
either sent or purged.

In hindsight, I find it hilarious that I immediately assumed that it was
something I had nothing to do with, and I thought it to be more likely that a
virus had somehow in parallel infected several subscribers of the mailbox, than
that I just had done a stupid mistake while setting up the mailing list. 

## How it ended
The theater was saved, simple as that, and both the website and the mailing list
were discontinued.
