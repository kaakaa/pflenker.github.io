I have to confess something: I am somewhat of a pet project hoarder.
Throughout my whole life, well before my formal education as a computer scientist,
I have been creating new things on the computer, usually by remixing or duplicating 
already existing things. Depending on how far things got, I started telling my family and
friends about it, hyping my own idea, before eventually getting bored of it and deleting 
it.

Looking through my pet projects is a bit like flipping through a photo album: 
In every image, you can see a noticable growth and change in relation to the previous one.
But mostly it's fun looking at how I did things in the past.

So I have decided to pick a few of these side projects and compile them into something
which I call a Pet Project Sematary - because very much like the animals in the book
of the same name, my long-dead pet projects have the tendency to unexpectedly come 
back to life.

I have selected these projects based on how funny or interesting I find them.
Please do not mistake this for a portfolio or something - this is what I do in the
dark, when no one looks.
