[A short riddle to test how biased you are.](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kFC7669quE) Telling you more about it would kind of give it away. Here is the riddle as text, the solution is in the video:

> A father is about to bring his son to a job interview, applying for a position at a large stockbrokers company in the city. Just as they arrive at the company's parking lot, the son's phone rings. He looks at his father, who says: "Go ahead, answer it." The caller is the trading company's CEO who says: "Good luck son, you've got this." The son ends the call and once again looks at his father, who is still next to him in their car.  
> How is this possible?
