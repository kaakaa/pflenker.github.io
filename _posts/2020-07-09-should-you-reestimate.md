[Should you re-estimate your work while you do it or
not?](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/to-re-estimate-or-not-that-is-the-question),
discussed in the context of agile estimation techniques. My stance is to never
re-estimate after work has been started, even if it's a huge outlier. Because we
tend to only re-estimate stuff where we have been too optimistic, and not items
where we have been too pessimistic - which would then skew the final result.
Also, even exceptional outliers are part of the usual business - they happen,
and if we take them out by re estimating them, we assume that they will not
happen in the future.
