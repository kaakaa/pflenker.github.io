[A Chinese video blogger pretending to be a young beauty queen was revealed to be a middle-aged woman as her filter failed during a live stream](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-49151042), which tells you a lot about where we are headed as a society. 

A few years ago there was a case where a woman was pretending to be a single man by using a voice changing software with Skype - enabling a filter to change the apperance while being live on air is a completely different level though.

(**Update**: [Beauty filter are common among chinese vloggers, and this might very well have been a deliberate Public Relations stunt.](https://nerdcore.de/2019/07/31/beauty-filter-glitch-waehrend-livestream/) )
