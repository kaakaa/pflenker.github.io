[A Chinese video blogger pretending to be a young beauty queen was revealed to be a middle-aged woman as her filter failed during a live stream](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-49151042), which tells you a lot about where we are headed as a society. 

A few years ago there was a case where a woman was pretending to be a single man by using a voice changing software with Skype - enabling a filter to change the apperance while being live on air is a completely different level though.
