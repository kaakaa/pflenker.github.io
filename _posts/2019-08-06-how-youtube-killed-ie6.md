[How YouTube killed IE6](https://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6):

>We somehow got away with our plan to kill IE6 without facing any meaningful corrective action. Few people even knew we were involved at all and those that did, did not want to bring attention to it or risk encouraging similar behavior. At a beer garden in San Francisco, our boss, winking his hardest, made us swear to never do anything like this again. We agreed, toasted IE6 falling into single digit percentages, and never snuck anything into production again.

Not that I particularily miss IE6, but imagine the outcry if the situation had been reversed, and it would have been Microsoft employees killing off some other piece of software!
