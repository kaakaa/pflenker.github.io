One part of my job is coaching Product Owners, Product Managers and people 
in other roles who are interested in Product Owner related topics. I am currently offering a weekly Lean Coffee, where everyone can bring questions and challenges, 
and we as a group discuss them.

Here, I will collect some interesting questions that have arisen on these occurences, as well as the answers we found:

- [When or how often should you change your product vision?]({% post_url 2020-10-14-how-often-should-you-change-the-vision%})
- [How strictly should we stick to the rules of Scrum and Kanban?]({% post_url 2020-10-14-how-strictly-should-we-stick-to-the-rules%})
