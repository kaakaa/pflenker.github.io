[The longer something has taken, the longer it will take.](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/21/power-law-projects/)
This effect has a significant impact on any estimate on when an overdue project 
will finally be done - intuition and hope says it will be done soon, the math and experience says it won't.

Related to that is the [Lindy Effect](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/12/17/the-lindy-effect/): The longer a technology has been around, the longer it is likely to stay around. This has implications on, among other things, architecture.
