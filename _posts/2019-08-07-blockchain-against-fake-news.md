[The New York Times thinks a blockchain could help stamp out fake news](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614007/the-new-york-times-thinks-a-blockchain-could-help-stamp-out-fake-news/)

> In a new blog post, project lead Sasha Koren explains that by using a blockchain, “we might in theory provide audiences with a way to determine the source of a photo, or whether it had been edited after it was published.”

Looking past the "Use the blockchain, save the world" rhetoric - the main issue is not the fake news in itself, but the virality of it, and it is well known that corrections of articles don't make it as far as the originals.  We already have problems with Fake News which can be debunked without Blockchain.
