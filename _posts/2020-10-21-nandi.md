Nice little drum-off between [Nandi Bushell ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbMg1QLaHBzmww35QK-mHEQ) and [Dave Grohl](https://twitter.com/officialdavepag?lang=en).

It started with [Nandi covering Everlong by the Foo Fighters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRvHI8tgx8A), to which Dave [responded with a challenge to cover Dead End Friends by Them Crooked Vultures](https://twitter.com/foofighters/status/1299740995538485248). 
Nandi [executed this challenge beautifully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZBQW2gE0Ew&list=PL0B-SSjYdybBRF4tbXLAl4WDBhOQbydod&index=3), and then Grohl [wrote a song just for her](https://twitter.com/foofighters/status/1305517568946438144).

Nandi is a kick-ass role model, and my daughters adore her. Well done!
