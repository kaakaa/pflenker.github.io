You can now [play Mario in vim](https://github.com/rbtnn/vim-mario). Of course,
you can do the same and more in emacs, for which [a full NES emulator is
available.](https://github.com/gongo/emacs-nes)

This brings back memories from school, where we used our sophisticated calculators
mainly [for playing games on them.](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~pad/ti92p.html)
