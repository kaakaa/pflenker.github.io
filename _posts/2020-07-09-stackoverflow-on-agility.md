[Does scrum ruin great engineers or are you doing it wrong?](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/29/does-scrum-ruin-great-engineers-or-are-you-doing-it-wrong/), authored by 
StackOverflow, which in itself is reason enough to read it.

I think one of the reasons why Scrum (or agility in general) has such as bad 
standing is because it tends to surface problems which are already there in the
company, and makes them transparent. Consequently, it's easier to shoot the 
messenger than to acknowledge and work on the problems.
