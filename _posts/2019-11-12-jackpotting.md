[Malware for ATMs causes them to spit out all the money that they
have.](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/br-recherche/geldautomaten-cyberkriminalitaet-101.html).
Looking at the details of this is scary:
- ATMs are apparently running on Windows
- They are not always running with the latest patches
- It seems to be possible to connect any USB device to it in some cases
- It also seems to be possible to run any program on these windows machines

To be honest, you had me at "Windows"!
